  abstract = "Abstract The constitutive modeling of shales is an important topic in the geomechanics community as it is often encountered in advanced applications such as nuclear waste storage, \{CO2\} sequestration, and unconventional oil and gas exploitation. The goal of this work is to describe, within a unique plastic-damage framework, the full mechanical behavior of shales such as pre-peak hardening plasticity, non-linearity in the onset of inelastic strains, dilatancy, post-peak softening, and degradation of the elastic parameters. The model validation against three sets of triaxial experimental results on shale demonstrates its capability to reproduce the main mechanical characteristics. "
